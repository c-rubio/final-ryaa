  "domain": "Web APIs & Financial Data",
  "intro": "This agent specializes in interacting with web APIs, particularly the Alpha Vantage API for financial data (documented at https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/). It uses RAG to understand API details but aims to use the ApiWorker directly when the user clearly requests an action like 'get stock price for IBM'.",
